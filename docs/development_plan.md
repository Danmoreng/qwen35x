# qwen35x Development Plan

This plan summarizes the original project direction and turns it into a public, implementation-focused roadmap.

## Vision

Build a standalone, hardware-aware inference engine specialized for the Qwen3.5 architecture family, starting with `Qwen3.5-0.8B` and scaling to larger variants later.

Core strategy:
- Keep the stack small and explicit
- Prioritize architecture-specific fast paths over generic abstractions
- Use reference implementations for correctness, then replace hotspots with specialized kernels

## Target Profile

- Initial model: `Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B`
- Initial platform: NVIDIA GPU class used in this project environment
- Initial precision path: dense reference + CUDA-hybrid bring-up
- Future target: larger Qwen3.5 variants with the same engine architecture

## Design Principles

- Use a compiler/runtime split:
- Compiler: parse model metadata, build static execution plan, prepare packed tensors
- Runtime: execute prefill/decode and manage caches, dispatch, and memory
- Keep correctness and speed work separate:
- CPU reference path is the oracle
- GPU path must match token-by-token before heavy optimization
- Optimize measured bottlenecks first:
- Decode path and cache updates before broad refactors
- Build for extensibility:
- The code should be easy to retarget to other model sizes and GPUs

## Architecture Milestones

1. Baseline Bring-up
- Load HF model config and safetensors
- Implement tokenizer encode/decode
- End-to-end CPU reference inference

2. Hybrid Attention Correctness
- Support Qwen3.5 mixed layer schedule (`linear_attention` + `full_attention`)
- Maintain both full-attention KV cache and linear recurrent/conv states
- Validate stable text generation for simple prompts

3. CUDA-Hybrid Acceleration
- Add `--infer-gpu` path
- Offload matrix-heavy operations to CUDA
- Keep attention math in reference form until parity is stable

4. Generation Controls and Usability
- Add chat prompt wrapper mode
- Add default sampling and override flags
- Add deterministic mode with seed control
- Add stop-token and stop-text handling

5. Kernel Specialization Phase
- Replace CUDA stubs with real decode kernels
- Prioritize full-attention GQA decode kernel
- Add linear-attention recurrent update kernels
- Introduce packed weight layout for target GPU class

6. Prefill and Scheduling
- Optimize prefill separately from decode
- Add persistent runtime buffers
- Add profiling-driven dispatch and graph execution improvements

7. Low-Precision Phase
- Add one clear low-precision path first (instead of many formats at once)
- Keep fallback and correctness tests for every precision mode

## Validation and Benchmarking Plan

- Correctness tests:
- CPU vs GPU token-level parity for fixed prompts
- Deterministic sampling with known seeds
- Benchmark suite:
- Decode tokens/sec
- Prefill throughput
- Load time and memory footprint
- Regression gates:
- Keep simple prompts and expected token outputs as smoke checks

## Practical Next Steps

1. Complete full GPU attention math path (remove remaining CPU bottlenecks in `--infer-gpu`)
2. Add parity test scripts for CPU/GPU with fixed seeds
3. Add packed-tensor pipeline for decode-critical weights
4. Profile and iterate kernel implementations by measured hotspots
